* Intro
This is a super basic spring boot sample project that was created for learning purposes.

The project is basically a =Todo= server app.
It uses the power of *spring boot* to create the database schema and the power of =Docker= to manage the two involved services, which are:

1. A PostgreSQL database
2. An Spring boot REST server

Below you can see a general architecture overview of the project.

* Database model

For the database we have two tables:
1. author
2. todo

Each table represents an entity in spring boot class models =Author= and =Todo=.

They have an 1-M (one to many) relationship.
